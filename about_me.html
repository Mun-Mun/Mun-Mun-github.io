        <h1>BIO</h1>
        <p>My name is Muntadhir (Muhn-tah-deer) Al-Shamri (Al-Shuh-mri), but I go by the name Munti.
            I am currently attending Indiana University Bloomington majoring in Computer Science,
            specializing in systems, and minoring in Informatics and Epidemiology.
            I was born in Mishawaka and raised next door in the city of Elkhart, a small city located up on the state line by Michigan.
            Being an Arab-American, I visited my parent's birth country many times; Iraq, the country where my father was born, and Morocco,
            the country where my mother was born. Visiting these countries and seeing the culture firsthand gave me incentive to travel more in the world,
            especially the South-Eastern Asian countries. </p>

        <h1>HOBBIES</h1>
        <p>Most of my hobbies relate to technology. I like catching up with the latest processes in both phones and computer parts.
            I enjoy messing with hardware, such as building or fixing computers. Outside of computers, I enjoy going to the gym, watching anime, playing video games, running, and learning new hobbies.
            Currently, I'm learning how to play the guitar and how to knit.</p>
